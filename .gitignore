In this example, we use a for loop to prompt the user for grades for each subject. We use a try-except block to check if the input is valid (i.e., a number between 0 and 100). If the input is valid, we add it to a running total of grades and increment the number of subjects. 
After the loop, we calculate the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of subjects. If no valid grades were entered, we output an appropriate message.
